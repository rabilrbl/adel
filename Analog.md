## Multivibrator

A multivibrator is an electronic circuit used to implement a variety of simple two-state devices such as relaxation oscillators, timers, and flip-flops.

### Applications

- They are used as a Frequency dividers.
- Used as a saw tooth generators.
- They are used as wave and pulse generators.
- They are used as standard frequency source.
- They are used in radar and tv circuits.
- They are also used as a memory elements in computer.

### Monostable multivibrator

Monostable multivibrator, in which one of the states is stable, but the other state is unstable (transient).

### Astable multivibrator

Astable multivibrator, in which the circuit is not stable in either state â€”it continually switches from one state to the other. It functions as a relaxation oscillator.

### Bistable multivibrator

Bistable multivibrator, in which the circuit is stable in either state. It can be flipped from one state to the other by an external trigger pulse. This circuit is also known as a flip-flop. It can store one bit of information, and is widely used in digital logic and computer memory.

## Op-Amp

An operational amplifier is an integrated circuit that can amplify weak electric signals. An operational amplifier has two input pins and one output pin.

Its basic role is to amplify and output the voltage difference between the two input pins.

### Applications

- Enables substantial amplification of an input signal
- Enables elimination of noise from an input signal

## Relaxation Oscillator

A relaxation oscillator is a nonlinear electronic oscillator circuit that produces a nonsinusoidal repetitive output signal, such as a triangle wave or square wave.

### Applications

- Voltage control oscillator
- Memory circuits
- Signal generator (to generate clock signals)
- Stroboscopes
- Firing thyristor-based circuit
- Multi-vibrators
- Television receivers
- Counters

## Window Comparator

Window comparator is an op-amp voltage comparator that compares magnitudes of two voltage inputs and deteremines which the largest of the two.
